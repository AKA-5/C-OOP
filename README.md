# C-OOP
This Repository illustrates the relationships between classes (Composition, Aggregation or Inheritance) through code implementation.

**CASE STUDY Problem:**

In this case study We will be creating a customized PC/MAC laptop according to the user requirements.
Our program will show the total price of product with a detailed bill at the end.
In this question, you need to write a host of classes, and place them in a reasonable hierarchy. 
UML Diagram is added in this Repository

Description: 
In this portion we will write all the classes with their constructors,destructors,getter,setter,etc. 

Classes Included:
1. Class ALU
2. Class ControlUnit
3. Class CPU 
4. Class MainMemory
5. Class Port
6. Class MotherBoard
7. Class PhysicalMemory
8. Class GraphicCard
9. Class StorageDevice
10. Class NetworkCard
11. Class PowerSupply
12. Class Battery
13. Class Case
14. Class ComputerAssembly
15. Class Computer (Covering all the above classes)

We will create a new Computer Object (PC or Mac) by taking all necessary 
specifications from user. In case of an incorrect input, our code will provide the error to the user and restart the 
process. Finally, we will display the specifications and the price of the computer.
